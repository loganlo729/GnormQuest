# GnormQuest
An early prototype/demo for a turn-based RPG about a reality-altering gnome placed in the everyday town of Sleepsom. 
I intend to completely overhaul everything shown in this demo, as this was made as a starter project within a few months of using Unreal Engine 5.

Since this is a relatively straightforward RPG with some movement mechanics, I decided to upload the UE5 project file in its entirely.
It's not perfect; it desperately needs to be trimmed of unused content and repetitive code, but it is a functional, bug-free (in my testing) prototype for an RPG.
I will update this project later with completely new assets and gameplay, but if you would like to see the existing code, it is all available.

A great deal of time was spent on creating a working turn-based system that combines grid movement with a traditional action menu. Most of this project was
created without the use of plugins, so I had to find my own methods for dialogue, combat, and menus. I am proud of the functionality of these systems, but I aim to make them
more modular and performance-centered in future releases.
